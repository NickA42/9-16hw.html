  Similarities in Learning Theories: Muller and Dweck 
  </h1>
  <h2>
  There are many differences in their beliefs on how people learn. Along with their differences, they do have a few similarities. One of the main similarities is that both videos support the idea of people learning from their mistakes by <em> making </em> mistakes. In the video with Carol Dweck, she comments on how the growth mindset is the mindset of one that pushes themselves beyond error- and thus, correcting it. The same can be said for Derek Muller, in his video he is criticised for making people look dumb when having the wrong answers but he explains that it was only because he feels useful when other people make mistakes because he knows he can guide them towards correction. Both Dweck and Muller have different theories on how people learn but ultimately have the similarity of correcting mistakes to further someones knowledge.
